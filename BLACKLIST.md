# Blacklist

A listing of support that this mod explicitly **will not add**.

If you create an issue requesting support for one of these topics, or if you create a pull request that implements support for one of these topics, **it will be closed without discussion**.

## **\<Difficulty Mode\> AI Changes**
Revengeance Mode, Death Mode, Eternity Mode, etc.

Adding support for a modded difficulty mode requires more familiarity with both the difficulty and the boss than I likely have. It's also a massive commitment to ensure that the changes aren't only balanced when they're implemented, but also when either mod involved updates and shifts its own balance.

## **Cross-Mod Class Content**
For example, Calamity-themed Bard items.

Simply put, this mod only exists to add support between other mods and their system, not to add meaningful content. This mod *may* add content for the purpose of support, but something as involved as cross-mod equipment is much better suited for a dedicated mod with dedicated developer(s).
