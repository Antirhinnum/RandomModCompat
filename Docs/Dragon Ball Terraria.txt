[b]This is an unstable change.[/b] It may break when this mod is reloaded, and the underlying bug may be fixed in a future Dragon Ball Terraria update. 
For reference, this bug is guaranteed to be present on "Dragon Ball Terraria 1.0.9.9 Ported" version 0.3.3. This fix is automatically disabled if a version higher than 0.3.3 is used.
