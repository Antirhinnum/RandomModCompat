Currently, there are two Achievement mods in Comaptibility APIs.txt.
Both of these provide the same function, so there should probably be some shared API between them.

Achievement Mod calls need:
    [Mod]                   Mod instance
    [string]                Achievement internal name
    [AchievementCategory]   Category
    [string]                Texture path (128x64)
    [string?]               Custom border path ()
