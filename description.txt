Assorted Mod Compatibility adds a lot of compatibility between several mods. Support added by this mod can be enabled/disabled by the user.

Some examples of current compatibility:
 - Many modded bosses now drop Shadow Diamonds if Magic Storage is enabled.
 - Mech Bosses Rework's new mech bosses now draw Strange Plating if Thorium Mod is enabled.
 - The sheath accessories from Thorium Mod can be worn asymmetrically with Asymmetric Equipment.

See the Discussions tab on the Workshop page for a detailed breakdown of compatibility, as well as links to all mods and a planning post.
** If you're having mysterious issues with Auto Reforge, Dragon Ball Terraria, Level+, Melee Effects+, or Thorium Mod, see the Steam Workshop page! **
