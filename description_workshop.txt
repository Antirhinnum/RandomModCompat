Assorted Mod Compatibility adds a lot of compatibility between several mods. Support added by this mod can be enabled/disabled by the user.

Some examples of current compatibility:[list][*]Many modded bosses now drop Shadow Diamonds if Magic Storage is enabled.
[*]Mech Bosses Rework's new mech bosses now drop Strange Plating if Thorium Mod is enabled.[/list]

See the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/discussions/2976409348]Discussions tab[/url] for a detailed breakdown of compatibility, as well as links to all mods and a planning post.

[b]If you're experiencing bugs:[/b]
Go into this mod's "Misc. Config" and check "Disable IL Edits", then restart the game.
If the issue still happens, report it on the GitHub!
If it doesn't, then you're facing an issue with this mod's IL edits. You can keep "Disable IL Edits" on, but doing so disables some support.
To circumvent this issue, [b]don't reload mods after starting the game[/b]. This will (hopefully) be fixed when the mod ports to 1.4.4, but it's out of my control for now.
